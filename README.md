# 🐍 Python Course Repository  

This repository has been created to **share the code from the Python course**.  
Since these are **class exercises and explanations**, the code may not be fully complete or structured as a final project.  

## 🎯 Purpose  
The main goal is to provide students with **a reference outside the classroom** to **recall foundational concepts** and **practice coding exercises**.  

## ⚙️ What's Inside?  
- ✅ **Classwork & Exercises**  
- ✅ **Lecture Notes & Explanations**  
- ✅ **Code snippets for practice**  

## 📌 Notes  
- These files **are not meant to be a fully developed project** but serve as a learning reference.  
- Contributions & improvements are welcome to make this repository more useful!  

---
## 💡 Final Note  
I hope my dear students find these code snippets useful in their learning journey.  
Feel free to explore, modify, and build upon them to strengthen your programming skills! 🚀
